# YATODO (Yet Another TODO)

This is a simple TODO app made as an exercise in learning Django and Django-REST.

Tasks are required to have a title and optional description.

Once it is created, it can change states: 
* TODO - first state
* STARTED - working on it.
* WAITING - waiting on the task. Someone or something is blocking.
* DONE - task is finished.

Tasks may be deleted or archived.
